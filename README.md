## Assignment: AI musical instrument

A front-end for a musical instrument that generates music visualizations based on data. You want to give the user the opportunity to customize the end result. "Things" like DALL-E and Midjourney have a fairly linear output, namely an input and an output. During this project, a user wants to "steer" the output with multiple moments of input.

## My work

Sketch ideas

<img src="/readme/schets.jpg" alt="schets ideeen">


I've built a site that allows the user to play with notes using a simple piano pad. With two piano boards, one for chords and the other for solo notes, the user has the ability to choose what they want to play.

## Test

**First test:**

The reaction was positive, but I noticed some negative points:
- Additional buttons (Reset\Add Piano\ dark mode) are small.
- The additional buttons (adding a piano / dark mode) are located in the lowest corners, so they were not quickly noticed.
- Fix colors when changing the modÿ´.
- The pause button did not appear after playing the tones

**The second test:**

I fixed a large part of the previous mistakes from the first test.
The reaction was positive and I was fortunate that this person had some knowledge of the piano.

He was confused at first because the tone symbols didn't match the buttons like they would on a real piano so he advised me to try to improve on that.
